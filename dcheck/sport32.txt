Australia spinner Nathan Lyon has labelled India’s Cheteshwar Pujara, who tormented the Aussies during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2018/19, as the ‘New Wall’ of the Indian side. Pujara scored 521 runs in the series as India claimed their first-ever series win on Australian soil.

Despite missing both David Warner and Steve Smith in their XI, the Aussies had their pace battery loaded up to challenge India in the Border Gavaskar Trophy in 2018/19, with everyone fit and firing. However, while the team charted out a well-thought-of plan for Virat Kohli, they made the fatal error of taking Pujara lightly and the Saurashtra man made the Kangaroos pay, scoring 521 runs in the series to propel India to a series win.
