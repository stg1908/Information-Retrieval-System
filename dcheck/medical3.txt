Coronary artery disease, also known as "ischemic heart disease",[60] is a group of diseases that includes: stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death.[61] It is within the group of cardiovascular diseases of which it is the most common type.[62] A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw.[63] Occasionally it may feel like heartburn. Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress, last less than a few minutes, and get better with rest.[63] Shortness of breath may also occur and sometimes no symptoms are present.[63] The first sign is occasionally a heart attack.[64] Other complications include heart failure or an irregular heartbeat.[64]

Risk factors include: high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol, among others.[65][66] Other risks include depression.[67] The underlying mechanism involves atherosclerosis of the arteries of the heart. A number of tests may help with diagnoses including: electrocardiogram, cardiac stress testing, coronary computed tomographic angiography, and coronary angiogram, among others.[68]

Prevention is by eating a healthy diet, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking.[69] Sometimes medication for diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure are also used.[69] There is limited evidence for screening people who are at low risk and do not have symptoms.[70] Treatment involves the same measures as prevention.[71][72] Additional medications such as antiplatelets including aspirin, beta blockers, or nitroglycerin may be recommended.[72] Procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be used in severe disease.[72][73] In those with stable CAD it is unclear if PCI or CABG in addition to the other treatments improve life expectancy or decreases heart attack risk.[74]

In 2013 CAD was the most common cause of death globally, resulting in 8.14 million deaths (16.8%) up from 5.74 million deaths (12%) in 1990.[62] The risk of death from CAD for a given age has decreased between 1980 and 2010 especially in developed countries.[75] The number of cases of CAD for a given age has also decreased between 1990 and 2010.[76] In the United States in 2010 about 20% of those over 65 had CAD, while it was present in 7% of those 45 to 64, and 1.3% of those 18 to 45.[77] Rates are higher among men than women of a given age.[77]
