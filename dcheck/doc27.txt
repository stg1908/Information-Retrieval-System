Prime Video, also marketed as Amazon Prime Video, is an American Internet video on demand service that is developed, owned, and operated by Amazon. It offers television shows and films for rent or purchase and Prime Video, a selection of Amazon Studios original content and licensed acquisitions included in the Amazon's Prime subscription. In the UK, US, Germany, and many other territories, access to Prime Video is also available through a video-only membership, which does not require a full Prime subscription.[2] In France and Italy, and other countries like Australia, Canada, India, etc. Prime Video content is only accessible through a dedicated Prime Video website. Rent or Buy option was launched for the first time on the dedicated prime video website on April 29, 2020 through Prime Video Store for Australia, Canada, France, Italy and Spain. In some countries Prime Video additionally offers Amazon Channels, which allows viewers to subscribe to other suppliers' content, including HBO in the United States.[3]

Launched on September 7, 2006 as Amazon Unbox in the United States, the service grew with its expanding library, and added the Prime Video membership with the development of Prime. It was then renamed as Amazon Instant Video on Demand. After acquiring the local streaming and DVD-by-mail service LoveFilm in 2011, Prime Video was added to Prime in the United Kingdom, Germany and Austria in 2014, a move that angered some Prime UK members as the bundling was non-negotiable with a 61% increase in subscription fee.[4]
