Star, and in turn Hotstar, were acquired by The Walt Disney Company in 2019, as part of its acquisition of their U.S. parent company 21st Century Fox. In August 2019, Disney CEO Bob Iger revealed that plans were in place for expansion of Hotstar into Southeast Asia.[18]

During a February 2020 earnings call, Iger announced that its recently launched international streaming brand Disney+ would be integrated into Hotstar as part of a re-launch on March 29, 2020. The existing Hotstar VIP and Premium tiers will be replaced by a co-branded service known as "Disney+ Hotstar", with one tier adding access to Disney's library content, and the premium tier adding access to Disney+ original programs. Iger stated that the service's launch (originally scheduled to coincide with opening day of the 2020 Indian Premier League) would take advantage of Hotstar's "proven platform" and existing customer base. The Motley Fool described Hotstar as being Disney's "secret weapon" in the market due to its already-dominant position.[19][20][21]

Hotstar began to soft launch the expanded service for some users in March. On 20 March 2020, in recognition of the coronavirus pandemic and associated delay of the IPL season to 15 April, Disney announced that it had postponed the launch to 3 April.[22][23] Disney+ Hotstar was launched on the said date with a "virtual red carpet premiere".[24] The change did not affect the platform outside of India, as it coexists with Disney+ as separate services.
