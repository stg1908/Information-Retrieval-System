Cardiac arrest is a sudden stop in effective blood flow due to the failure of the heart to contract effectively.[78] Symptoms include loss of consciousness and abnormal or absent breathing.[79][80] Some people may have chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea before this occurs.[80] If not treated within minutes, death usually occurs.[78]

The most common cause of cardiac arrest is coronary artery disease. Less common causes include major blood loss, lack of oxygen, very low potassium, heart failure, and intense physical exercise. A number of inherited disorders may also increase the risk including long QT syndrome. The initial heart rhythm is most often ventricular fibrillation.[81] The diagnosis is confirmed by finding no pulse.[79] While a cardiac arrest may be caused by heart attack or heart failure these are not the same.[78]

Prevention includes not smoking, physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight.[82] Treatment for cardiac arrest is immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and, if a shockable rhythm is present, defibrillation.[83] Among those who survive targeted temperature management may improve outcomes.[84] An implantable cardiac defibrillator may be placed to reduce the chance of death from recurrence.[82]

In the United States, cardiac arrest outside of hospital occurs in about 13 per 10,000 people per year (326,000 cases). In hospital cardiac arrest occurs in an additional 209,000[85] Cardiac arrest becomes more common with age. It affects males more often than females.[86] The percentage of people who survive with treatment is about 8%. Many who survive have significant disability. Many U.S. television shows, however, have portrayed unrealistically high survival rates of 67%.[87]

A congenital heart defect, also known as a "congenital heart anomaly" or "congenital heart disease", is a problem in the structure of the heart that is present at birth.[88] Signs and symptoms depend on the specific type of problem.[89] Symptoms can vary from none to life-threatening.[88] When present they may include rapid breathing, bluish skin, poor weight gain, and feeling tired.[90] It does not cause chest pain.[90] Most congenital heart problems do not occur with other diseases.[89] Complications that can result from heart defects include heart failure.[90]

The cause of a congenital heart defect is often unknown.[91] Certain cases may be due to infections during pregnancy such as rubella, use of certain medications or drugs such as alcohol or tobacco, parents being closely related, or poor nutritional status or obesity in the mother.[89][92] Having a parent with a congenital heart defect is also a risk factor.[93] A number of genetic conditions are associated with heart defects including Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Marfan syndrome.[89] Congenital heart defects are divided into two main groups: cyanotic heart defects and non-cyanotic heart defects, depending on whether the child has the potential to turn bluish in color.[89] The problems may involve the interior walls of the heart, the heart valves, or the large blood vessels that lead to and from the heart.[88]

Congenital heart defects are partly preventable through rubella vaccination, the adding of iodine to salt, and the adding of folic acid to certain food products.[89] Some defects do not need treatment.[88] Other may be effectively treated with catheter based procedures or heart surgery.[94] Occasionally a number of operations may be needed.[94] Occasionally heart transplantation is required.[94] With appropriate treatment outcomes, even with complex problems, are generally good.[88]

Heart defects are the most common birth defect.[89][95] In 2013 they were present in 34.3 million people globally.[95] They affect between 4 and 75 per 1,000 live births depending upon how they are diagnosed.[89][93] About 6 to 19 per 1,000 cause a moderate to severe degree of problems.[93] Congenital heart defects are the leading cause of birth defect-related deaths.[89] In 2013 they resulted in 323,000 deaths down from 366,000 deaths in 1990.[96]
