PUNE : Germany-headquartered internet exchange operator DE-CIX said there has been a change in internet user behaviour in India following the lockdown, with customers also ordering larger data capacities.

“Gaming traffic has increased by 50% in the last few weeks, with doubling of traffic in video streaming and collaborative work apps like Skype, Teams and Zoom,” said Ivo Ivanov, CEO of DE-CIX International, which runs an internet exchange in Mumbai.

The overall internet traffic in the first two weeks of the lockdown, which began on March 25, increased by 1 terabyte, said Ivanov, 30-40% higher than normal.

While a lot of internet traffic shifted from offices and institutions to homes, people are also doing a lot more online. “A lot of social interactions are now happening online, so even though business traffic has dropped, the overall volume of traffic has increased,” said Ivanov.

From children being educated to artistes performing online, several new user groups have emerged, leading to increase in internet traffic.

The shift in consumption patterns are in line with global patterns. DE-CIX runs the world’s largest internet exchange in Frankfurt, where it has recorded videoconferencing traffic increase of about 50%, with demand for additional customer capacities increasing 20% worldwide.
