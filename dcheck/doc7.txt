In September 2017, Star Sports acquired the entirety of the media rights to the Indian Premier League, with Hotstar acting as the international digital rightsholder. Afterward, Hotstar launched an international subscription service in Canada and the United States, aimed towards providing its domestic Indian content and sports.[10][11] Hotstar launched in the United Kingdom in September 2018, to coincide with the 2018 Asia Cup.[12]

In May 2018, it was reported that the service had 75-100 million active users per-month.[13] In September 2018, Hotstar CEO Ajit Mohan left to become the vice-president and managing director of Facebook India.[14] That month, it was reported that the service had begun to restructure its leadership to have separate executives for its ad-supported and premium services, and, aided by new funding from Star US Holdings, planned to increase its production of premium original content to better-compete with Amazon and Netflix, amidst concerns that the service was beginning to hemorrhage cash.[15]

On January 4, 2019, Star discontinued their international linear pay television channels in the U.S. (such as StarPlus), in order to focus more on marketing the Hotstar service in the market as an alternative.[16]

By 2019, the service had over 150 million active users monthly. In March 2019, ahead of the 2019 Indian Premier League, Hotstar migrated existing subscribers of its All Annual Sports plan to a new entry-level plan known as Hotstar VIP. Intended as an introductory option, it includes access to sports content (including the IPL, 2019 Cricket World Cup, and English Premier League football), early access to serials before their television broadcast, access to content from the new Hotstar Specials banner of content, and can be paid for using cash. Chief product officer Varun Narang described the offering as "a value proposition built with the Indian audience at the heart of it".[17]
