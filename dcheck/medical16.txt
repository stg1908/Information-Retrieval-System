Hypertension, also known as "high blood pressure"", is a long term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.[16] High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms.[17] Long term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease.[18][19]

Lifestyle factors can increase the risk of hypertension. These include excess salt in the diet, excess body weight, smoking, and alcohol.[17][20] Hypertension can also be caused by other diseases, or as a side-effect of drugs.

Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic pressures, which are the maximum and minimum pressures, respectively.[17] Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100–140 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60–90 mmHg diastolic.[21] High blood pressure is present if the resting blood pressure is persistently at or above 140/90 mmHg for most adults.[20] Different numbers apply to children.[22] Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period appears more accurate than office best blood pressure measurement.[16][20]

Lifestyle changes and medications can lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of health complications.[23] Lifestyle changes include weight loss, decreased salt intake, physical exercise, and a healthy diet.[20] If lifestyle changes are not sufficient then blood pressure medications are used.[23] Up to three medications can control blood pressure in 90% of people.[20] The treatment of moderate to severe high arterial blood pressure (defined as >160/100 mmHg) with medications is associated with an improved life expectancy and reduced morbidity.[24] The effect of treatment of blood pressure between 140/90 mmHg and 160/100 mmHg is less clear, with some reviews finding benefit[25][26] and others finding a lack of evidence for benefit.[27] High blood pressure affects between 16 and 37% of the population globally.[20] In 2010 hypertension was believed to have been a factor in 18% (9.4 million) deaths.[28]
