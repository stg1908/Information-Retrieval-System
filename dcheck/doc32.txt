BLEACH' ANIME TO RETURN IN 2021; 'BURN THE WITCH' GETS SERIALIZATION AND ANIME

fter eight long years, the Bleach anime is returning!

In the recent issue of Jump Magazine in Japan, it was revealed that creator Tite Kubo's popular Shonen series will return in 2021. The anime will cover the "Thousand-Year Blood War," which begins in Chapter 480 of the manga to the end of the series in Chapter 686.

No further details on the anime adaptation was revealed.

Bleach fans were devastated when the anime was halted in 2012 after the completion of the "Fullbringer" arc. No official reason was given for the series' cancellation, but many believe that the rising costs of production along with the anime catching up to the manga too quickly were major factors.

Jump magazine also revealed that Burn the Witch, a one-shot from Kubo that debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in June 2018, will be serialized starting this summer with an anime of its own beginning in the Fall.

The story of Burn the Witch takes place in the same world as Bleach but focuses on a group of Shinigami 12 years after the "Thousand-Year Blood War." Also, instead of Japan, Burn the Witch takes place in London.
