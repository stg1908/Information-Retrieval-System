Sherlock season 5 release date, cast, trailer, plot: When is the new series out?

When will Sherlock season 5 be released?
There is no official release date for a new series of Sherlock but we can expect the show to arrive in either 2022 or 2023. 

Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman take the lead roles in the series, which ended back in 2017. 

We will have to wait for a clearer schedule before we know when the filming will begin, but it is hoped the new series will arrive in the next few years.   

Co-showrunner Steven Moffat told Digital Spy: “I haven't really thought about it. Mark [Gatiss, co-showrunner]’s been doing other stuff as well, so we haven't sat down and had a proper talk about what we would do with another series."

Who wil be in the cast of Sherlock season 5? 
Of course it is hoped Benedict Cumberbatch will return as the main character, and he will be joined by Martin Freeman as Watson. 

In the last series we met Sherlock's sister Eurus Holmes (played by Sian Brooke) who Sherlock himself did not remember existed. 

In an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk Sian Brooke said she would love to come back to play Eurus. 

She said: "It would be great, she is definitely a character I would love to revisit. You don’t get to play these parts every day, she’s abnormal and those sorts of parts are always great.

“She doesn’t respond or behave the way others do. I get asked questions about what would happen next to her. There is definitely more to the mind of that character.”
