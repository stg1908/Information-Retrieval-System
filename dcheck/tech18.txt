Google recently released a security warning for Chrome users across Windows, Mac, and Linux with a new security fix. The security warning released includes people upgrading to the latest Google Chrome version 81.0.4044.113. Google hasn't released any details yet about the security exploit.
As announced on a Google blog post, the new update includes security fixes and rewards. “Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed”, Google mentions in a blog post.
Keep in mind that the recently announced update is expected to roll out in the coming days/weeks so users can keep tabs on it. For users who want to check the version of Chrome they’re running they can do so by clicking the three vertical dots in the top right corner of the browser which gives you a slew of options to choose from. There you can select Help > About where you’ll be able to spot the version of your Chrome browser. If you don’t have the version updated, you must update it to keep your browser safe and secure.
In another news, Google announced, earlier this month in its Chromium blog post that it’s rolling back the enforcement of “SameSite cookie labeling” for a temporary period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The move is aimed to cause less interference for people from using sites as thousands of people across the globe have resorted to remote working.
“We want to ensure stability for websites providing essential services including banking, online groceries, government services and healthcare that facilitate our daily life during this time. As we roll back enforcement, organizations, users and sites should see no disruption”, reads the blog.
