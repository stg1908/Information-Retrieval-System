Over the course of the last few weeks, a common sight across the SB Nation family of soccer blogs has been the respective blog’s writers picking their own 5-a-side teams consisting of players of recent past. Our friends at Viola Nation took it a step further, playing a little game of picking a 5-a-side squad for each of the 20 teams in Serie A and using it as a way to decide the league title for the currently suspended season.

While we’re obviously not the first site to do this, the BWRAO crew decided to put our own spin on the proceedings.

Instead of having any kind of overlap, we had a true fantasy team draft — six rounds, six players per team, and have carte blanche to put a little salt in the wound of a blog friend while picking somebody they had their eye on at the same time you did. (And trust me, that happened.)

We had one rule about who could be picked: They must have played for Juventus during the club’s current eight-year run of winning the Scudetto. It didn’t matter if they played just a couple of games for Juventus or need nearly two hands to count all of the Serie A titles they won during their time in Turin, every Juventus player past or present dating back to Antonio Conte’s first game as manager in 2011 was eligible to be picked.
