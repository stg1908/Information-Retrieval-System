Everything We Know About Robert Pattinson And 'The Batman'
aving been taken on by the likes of Christian Bale and Michael Keaton, there are few superhero characters as iconic as Batman.

After disappointing reactions to the Batman vs Superman and Justice League films helmed by Zack Snyder, Warner Bros decided a change of direction was in order. Though Affleck penned a script and was due to direct and star in 2021's The Batman, he then walked away from the project entirely.

Now, after a long wait, firmer details are beginning to come to light about what we can expect from the next chapter of Gotham's resident hero.

Who's playing Batman?
The news that Affleck was hanging up his kevlar suit prompted debate about who would replace him. Would it be Hollywood heartthrob in the making Timothée Chalamet? Or perhaps a freed-from-Game of Thrones Kit Harington?

In May it was confirmed that Robert Pattinson would take on the role of the caped crusader, a great move we think, and one that gives Pattinson the chance to make a more mainstream film after recent arthouse hits like Claire Denis' High Life.

Describing the reaction to his casting as "less vitriolic than I was expecting," Pattinson himself seemed genuinely deeply surprised to have won the role when Esquire asked him about it. "It's kind of insane," Pattinson told us. "I was so far away from ever thinking it was a realistic prospect. I literally do not understand how I’ve got it, at all."
