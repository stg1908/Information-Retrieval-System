KOLKATA | MUMBAI : Shortage of labour and social distancing norms have been hampering supply of products to the market to meet the pent up demand as makers of smartphones, tablets and laptops are unable to scale up production and distributors work way below capacity.
Two senior industry executives said brands like Apple, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Realme are facing supply issues with operational plants running at 30-35% capacity and several warehouses are not able to operate normally.
For imported products like Apple’s iPad and Mac computers, and laptops of other brands, the entire supply-chain is impacted –from clearance at customs, warehouses to the distribution system. The Oppo plant in Greater Noida, which manufactures for Oppo, Realme and OnePlus, continues to remain shut after a few workers were found infected with Covid-19 a week back, industry executives said.
In contrast, the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry has managed to scale up capacities at 60-65% with 40-50% workforce in the plants producing products and packs which require lower manpower but still fall short of 40% of the demand.
Retailers said smartphone brands are unable to meet demand for entry-level models which has surged post-Covid, while supplies of tablets and laptops are also erratic.
“Retailers have almost exhausted their stock of sub-Rs 15,000 smartphones where lies the maximum demand and supplies are not coming at all,” said Arvinder Khurana, president of All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA).
