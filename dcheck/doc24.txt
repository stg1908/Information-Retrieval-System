Cartoon Network is an American basic cable television channel owned by Warner Bros. Entertainment, a division of AT&T's WarnerMedia. The channel was launched on October 1, 1992, and primarily broadcasts animated television series, mostly children's programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. It operates usually from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM (ET/PT) and is targeted at children between ages 7 and 15. Its overnight daypart block Adult Swim is aimed at young adults and is treated as a separate entity for promotional purposes and as a separate channel by Nielsen for ratings purposes.[1] A Spanish language audio track for select programs is accessible via second audio programing (SAP); some TV providers offer the Spanish feed as a separate channel by removing the main English-language audio track.
