Medical education is also the subject-didactic field of educating medical doctors at all levels, applying theories of pedagogy in the medical context, with its own journals, such as Medical Education. Researchers and practitioners in this field are usually medical doctors or educationalists. Medical curricula vary between medical schools, and are constantly evolving in response to the need of medical students, as well as the resources available.[48] Medical schools have been documented to utilize various forms of problem-based learning, team-based learning, and simulation.[49][50][51][52] The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) publishes standard guidelines regarding goals of medical education, including curriculum design, implementation, and evaluation.[3]

The Objective Structure Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are widely utilized as a way to assess health science students' clinical abilities in a controlled setting.[53][54] Although used in medical education programs throughout the world, the methodology for assessment may vary between programs and thus attempts to standardize the assessment have been made.[55][56]
