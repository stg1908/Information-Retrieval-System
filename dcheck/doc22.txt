in India, the service is operated as both a free ad-supported service, and two subscription-based tiers. The ad-supported service includes access to selected Indian films and Star series after their television broadcast. The Hotstar VIP subscription is oriented towards domestic content, including series from Star's Indian-language television networks and the Hotstar Specials banner, early access to Star's Indian television serial programs before their television premiere, cricket coverage, and Premier League football from the United Kingdom. The Hotstar Premium tier adds access to premium international films and series, including content from Disney, HBO, Showtime and Hooq.[25][26][27]

Some early original content on the service included the news comedy program On Air With AIB, and CinePlay. In March 2019, the service launched a new premium original content brand, Hotstar Specials, with the first production being Roar of the Lionâ€”a docudrama miniseries chronicling the Chennai Super Kings in the 2018 Indian Premier League. Hotstar stated that these series would be at least six episodes in length, be available in seven regional languages (Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu)[28] and focus on providing "big-scale, high-quality drama". Hotstar partnered with a large number of Indian filmmakers to produce series for the brand.[29][30][31]

In December 2015, Hotstar gained domestic streaming rights to current and past HBO original series, as part of Star's larger deal with the network.[32] It reached a similar deal with Showtime in July 2017.[33]

In October 2018, Hotstar partnered with Hooq to offer its content on its premium service, including rights to films and series from its co-owners Sony Pictures and Warner Bros., as well as its other content partners.

The HBO series Last Week Tonight has faced censorship on Hotstar. Two episodes were edited to remove jokes referencing Disney characters, including a November 2019 episode on the U.S. census (which cut a joke suggesting that Mickey Mouse was a "crack addict", and cropped the screen to obscure an on-screen graphic relating to the joke),[39] and a remark about Donald Duck's penis being "shaped like a corkscrew" during an episode discussing China's one-child policy.[40][41] In February 2020, Hotstar also refused to carry an episode that contained segments critical of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, which had alleged that his policy of Hindu nationalism was a growing threat to democracy in India.[42][43][44]

The programme's host John Oliver addressed all three instances of censorship by Hotstar in the 8 March 2020 episode. He placed a larger emphasis on the censorship of Disney references, however, jokingly arguing that he resented the censorship of his "factually accurate" Donald Duck joke more than the Modi episode being pulled, and alluded to his role of Zazu in Disney's 2019 CGI remake of The Lion King.[40][41]
