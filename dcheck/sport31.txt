Former India star all-rounder Yuvraj Singh while having an interactive chat with Rohit Sharma on Tuesday said there are not enough role models in the current Indian cricket team to look upto besides skipper Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma who play all three formats, adding that the line of respect for seniors has somewhat dimnished.

"The difference I find between the team of ours and now is during our time seniors were very disciplined. Social media was not there so no distraction also," Yuvraj said, answering to India's limited overs vice-captain Rohit Sharma's question on what is the difference between the team he played with, winning the 2007 T20 and the 2011 50-over World Cups, and the team now under Virat Kohli.
