Medical education is increasingly utilizing online teaching, usually within learning management systems (LMSs) or virtual learning environments (VLEs).[13][14] Additionally, several medical schools have incorporated the use of blended learning combining the use of video, asynchronous, and in-person exercises.[15][16] A landmark scoping review published in 2018 demonstrated that online teaching modalities are becoming increasingly prevalent in medical education, with associated high student satisfaction and improvement on knowledge tests. However, the use of evidence-based multimedia design principles in the development of online lectures was seldom reported, despite their known effectiveness in medical student contexts.[17] To enhance variety in an online delivery environment, the use of serious games, which have previously shown benefit in medical education [18], can be incorporated to break the monotony of online-delivered lectures.[19]

Research areas into online medical education include practical applications, including simulated patients and virtual medical records (see also: telehealth).[20] When compared to no intervention, simulation in medical education training is associated with positive effects on knowledge, skills, and behaviors and moderate effects for patient outcomes.[21] However, data is inconsistent on the effectiveness of asynchronous online learning when compared to traditional in-person lectures.[22][23] Furthermore, studies utilizing modern visualization technology (i.e. virtual and augmented reality) have shown great promise as means to supplement lesson content in physiological and anatomical education.[24][25]
