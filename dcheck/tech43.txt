The summer is almost here – and what better way to binge on boxsets and organise a movie night with your household than sitting outside in the sun. Obviously, with the UK's unpredictable weather, placing your current TV outdoors isn't the best idea, however, a new release from Samsung means you can finally watch your favourite shows out in the open ...regardless of whether or not some unexpected showers dampen things.
The South Korean firm has just announced the release of its new "The Terrace" gogglebox, which has been designed to survive the elements. In fact, Samsung boasts that it's been made with the weather in mind. The Terrace sports an IP55 rating which means it has durability against water and dust.
Available in 55-, 65- and 75-inch models, The Terrace fits perfectly with any outdoor living space and delivers Samsung’s industry-leading QLED 4K display technology and Smart TV features. If you're worried about not being able to see what's on the screen then Samsung also has that covered.
Not only does The Terrace feature an anti-reflective coating but the 4K display provides a brightness level of 2,000 nits, ensuring that users will be able to enjoy content in vivid picture quality, even in broad daylight.
